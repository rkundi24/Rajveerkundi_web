      <h2 class="a">About</h2>
      <p class="p1">The Playstation 1 was the first console that was released<br>
    by a company made by Sony called Playstation. By<br>
    December 2003, the PlayStation and PS one had shipped<br>
    a combined total of 102.49 million units, eventually becoming<br>
    the first video game console to sell 120 million units.</p>
    <p><h2>Early stages</h2></p>
    <p class="p2">Playstation was created because of a rivalry between them and Nintendo after Nintendo went back<br>
    on a deal that they we're supposed to have. This angered the people at Sony and then soon came the Playstation.<br>
    The playstation 1 was released in Japan in 1994 and it was a huge success selling over 2 million units. In the<br>
    next few years it became released everywhere in the wolrd. At the time they we're still behind Nintendo and their<br>
    extremely popular NES console, but not for long. </p>
