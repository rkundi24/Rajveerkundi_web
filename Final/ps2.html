      <h2 class="a">About</h2>
      <p class="p1">The Playstation 2 was the best selling home console<br>
      in the world, selling over 155 million units. With other<br>
      companies like Nintendo and Xbox trying to come into the<br>
      competition Playstation had to come out with something good,<br>
      and they did.
   </p>
    <p><h2>Early stages</h2></p>
    <p class="p2">The Playstation 2 was released in 2000, 6 years after the first console release. The console was positioned as<br>
    a competitor to the Sega dreamcast, the first of the sixth-generation consoles. On the first day of release Sony<br>
    raked in $250 million beating the previous record by over $100 million. Directly after the console was released,<br> 
    it was difficult to find the consoles on the shelves at stores so it was sold on ebay for thousands of dollars. At that time<br> 
    Sega went under a lot of fire and discontinued their console leaving the ps2 alone for a couple of years.    </p>
